What is BeCareful?
==================

BeCareful is a Git pre-commit hook on steroids. It abstracts some of the messier
bits of using the pre-commit hook away and lets you get down to business.

If you like to run linting tools like pep8 or jslint or if you just want to have
an automated way to make sure you didn't leave a ``debugger;`` line in you
script, BeCareful can help.
